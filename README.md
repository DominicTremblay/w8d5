### Learning a new language

When learning a new language, you learn about:

- Learn a new paradigm
- Learn a new framework
- Community behind the language

### Why Rails

- Learning a new language and framework
- Different approach to develop Web app
- Work with MVC pattern
- Coding with OO language
- A language/framework that makes your life easier

### Ruby on Rails

- Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in the mid-nineties
- Was designed for developer happiness and productivity
- Really took off with the release of Ruby on Rails (2005)

> Ruby introduced many concepts/features that made web development easier at the time. Other frameworks did implement features heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails

- Developer productivity
- Very Legible Code
- Develop a high-quality Web site rapidly
- Rich set of tooling and libraries out of the box
- Very good database functionality (ActiveRecord)
- Lots of abstraction

### Comparison between Ruby and JS

| JavaScript/NodeJS                     | Ruby/Rails                                                  |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Created in 10 days in 1995          | - Ruby was released in 1995 but took off with Rails in 2005 |

| - Primitive data types + object       | - all types are objects                                     |
| - More low level                      | - High-level of abstractions                                |
| - Highly-performant                   | - Performance issue                                         |
| - Very flexible                       | - Very opinionated                                          |
| - Not so easy to use migrations       | - Easy to use migrations                                    |
| - Fairly good for rapid development   | - Excellent for rapid prototyping and development           |
| - Multi-paradigm, event-driven        | - Mostly object-oriented                                    |
| - Largest ecosystem (npm)             | - Fairly big ecosystem (Rubygems)                           |
